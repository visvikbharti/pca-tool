# Gene Expression PCA Analysis Tool

A user-friendly, interactive web application for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on gene expression data.

![PCA Tool Demo](https://github.com/visvikbharti/pca-tool/raw/main/demo_images/demo.png)

## üî¨ About This Tool

This application was designed to help biologists analyze gene expression data without requiring programming knowledge. It automatically identifies sample groups and provides comprehensive visualizations and interpretations of PCA results.

You can access the deployed application here: [Gene Expression PCA Tool](https://visvikbharti-pca-tool.streamlit.app/)

## ‚ú® Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly design for biologists without coding experience
- **Flexible Data Import**: Support for CSV, TSV, and Excel files
- **Automatic Sample Detection**: Smart parsing of sample groups and replicates
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Customizable PCA plots with adjustable settings
- **Gene Loading Analysis**: Identify key genes driving differences between samples
- **Automatic Interpretation**: Get insights on variance, group separation, and gene contributions
- **High-Resolution Exports**: Download publication-ready figures in PNG, JPG, and PDF formats

## üìä Why Use This Tool?

Standard PCA tools often have limitations:
- They may require equal numbers of replicates across sample groups
- They might have rigid requirements for sample names
- Many lack intuitive interpretation of results

This tool addresses these issues with:
1. **Flexible Sample Grouping**: Handles uneven replicates
2. **Smart Group Detection**: Automatically identifies sample groups from column names
3. **Comprehensive Interpretation**: Provides meaningful biological context to your PCA results

   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501

## üìÅ Input Format

Your input file should follow these guidelines:
- First column: Gene identifiers (symbols or IDs)
- Subsequent columns: Expression values for each sample
- Sample names should ideally include group and replicate information (e.g., "Control_R1", "Treatment_R2")
- Supported formats: CSV, TSV, Excel (.xlsx/.xls)
